All around the internet, people are doing some brilliant things with development data; mapping conflicts, showing migration flows across the world, or highlighting corruption in their country. Here, we'll begin to collect some examples that we've come across - but as always, your suggestions are very welcome. Drop them in [this etherpad](http://okfnpad.org/p/developmentdataprojects) or drop us a line. And if you're working on a data driven project involving development data, we'd love [to hear from you!](mailto:zara.rahman@okfn.org)
